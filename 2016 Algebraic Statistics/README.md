Mathematica 10 notebooks for my talk "Algebraic Statistics & Quantifer Elimination". This talk was part of the seminar "Graphical modelling and network inference". All these examples demonstrate the application of quantifier elimination for problems related to directed Bayesian networks.

<code>3Vars.nb</code>: Deriving constraints on probabilities of the <code>A <- C -> B</code> Bayesian network (with C observale or C hidden).

<code>Membership.nb</code>: Ideal membership problem

<code>CHSH Expectation Values.nb</code>: Deriving constraints for correlators in the Bell scenario (it's actually a Fourier-Motzkin elimination)

<code>CHSH Probabilities</code>: Deriving constraints for the probabilities in the Bell scenario.
